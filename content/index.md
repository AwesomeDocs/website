> Fast in every way that matters

<note type="Modern web tech without the headache">
  Enjoy the power of the latest web technologies – React, Webpack, modern
  JavaScript and CSS and more — all set up and waiting for you to start.
</note>

<note type="Scale to the entire internet">
  Forget complicated deploys with databases and servers and their expensive,
  time-consuming setup costs, maintenance, and scaling fears. AwesomeDocs
  powered by Gatsby builds your site as "static" files which can be deployed
  easily on dozens of services.
</note>

<note type="Future-proof your website">
  Do not build a website with last decade's tech. The future of the web is
  mobile, JavaScript and APIs — the JAMstack. Every website is a web app and
  every web app is a website. AwesomeDocs powered by Gatsbyjs is the
  documentation generator you've been waiting for.
</note>

<note type="Static Progressive Web Apps">
  AwesomeDocs is built with Gatsby. Gatsby is a static PWA (Progressive Web App)
  generator. You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only
  the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as
  possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking
  around the site feels incredibly fast.
</note>

<note type="Speed past the competition">
  AwesomeDocs is built with Gatsby. Gatsby builds the fastest possible website.
  Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift
  them into a global cloud of servers — ready to be delivered instantly to your
  users wherever they are.
