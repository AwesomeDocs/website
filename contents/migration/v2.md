title: Migrating from AwesomeDocs to Docxy
description: This document serves the purpose of helping users migrate from Docxy v1 (AwesomeDocs) to Docxy v2.
---

The migration process will only take a couple of minutes.

Any documentation you've written for AwesomeDocs and any static assets you
bundled with it doesn't need to be changed in any way. You can directly copy
them over to Docxy and start using it seemlessly.

There are only few minor changes, as listed below, that you need to do to
migrate to Docxy.

## Contents Directory

The directory where all the markdown files and configurations lives is now
named `contents`. Previously it was named `content`.

## CLI

Docxy uses an entirely new CLI and therefore the AwesomeDocs CLI can't be used
for Docxy.

You need to get the new [Docxy CLI](/cli) to get started with Docxy.

## Configuration

Docxy has some new features and does what AwesomeDocs did in significantly
different ways. And therefore, some configuration options have been changed.

Checkout the [configuration reference](/config) to learn about the new
options to customize Docxy.
