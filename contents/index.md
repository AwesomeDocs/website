<note type="Modern web tech without the headache">
    Enjoy the power of the latest web technologies – React, Webpack, modern
    JavaScript and CSS and more — all set up and waiting for you to start.

<note type="Scale to the entire internet">
    Forget complicated deploys with databases and servers and their expensive,
    time-consuming setup costs, maintenance, and scaling fears. Docxy
    powered by Gatsby builds your site as "static" files which can be deployed
    easily on dozens of services.

<note type="Future-proof your website">
    Do not build a website with last decade's tech. The future of the web is
    mobile, JavaScript and APIs — the JAMstack. Every website is a web app and
    every web app is a website. Docxy powered by Gatsby is the
    documentation generator you've been waiting for.
</note>

<note type="Static Progressive Web Apps">
    Docxy is built with Gatsby. Gatsby is a static PWA (Progressive Web App)
    generator. You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only
    the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as
    possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking
    around the site feels incredibly fast.
</note>

<note type="Speed past the competition">
    Docxy is built with Gatsby. Gatsby builds the fastest possible website.
    Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift
    them into a global cloud of servers — ready to be delivered instantly to your
    users wherever they are.
</note>

> Docxy is fast in every way that matters.
